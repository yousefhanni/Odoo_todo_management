<!-- Your Menu Structure Right Now:
First Level (Root Menu):

To Do Task → This is the top-level menu item (Root Menu).
Second Level (Sub Menu):

To Do → This is a submenu inside the To Do Task menu.
The Action (Not a New Level):

All Tasks is another menu item under To Do, but it is still part of the second level.
It just triggers an action (opens the list of tasks) – it does not create a new menu level.            

If You Want 3 Levels:
You would need to create another menu item inside All Tasks or inside To Do, but right now you only have 2 levels:

Level 1: To Do Task
Level 2: To Do (and inside it, All Tasks)
